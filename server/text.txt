1. Profit Margin:

This metric reveals the profitability of your sales.
Calculation:

Profit Margin per Order = (SALES - (QUANTITYORDERED * PRICEEACH)) / SALES
Visualization:

Create a scatter plot with SALES on the x-axis and Profit Margin on the y-axis. This allows you to identify trends:
High sales with low margins could indicate aggressive discounting or high production costs.
Conversely, high margins with lower sales might suggest focusing on customer segments willing to pay a premium.
Benefits of Analyzing Profit Margin:

Identifies areas for potential cost optimization or improved pricing strategies.
Provides a more nuanced understanding of sales performance beyond just revenue.
2. Average Order Value (AOV):

This metric reflects the average amount spent per order.
Calculation:

Average Order Value = Total Sales / Number of Orders
Visualization:

Create a bar chart with a bar for each month or quarter (using MONTH_ID or QTR_ID) representing the AOV for that period.
Alternatively, a line chart can show trends in AOV over time.
Benefits of Analyzing AOV:

Identifies upselling or cross-selling opportunities.
Helps understand customer buying behavior and potential for larger orders.
Provides insights into marketing and promotional effectiveness.
